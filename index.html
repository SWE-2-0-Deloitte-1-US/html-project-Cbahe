            <p id="bio-info">I am Native American, I grew up on the reservation in a small community in Navajo County, where there was a single gas station and a small, unified school district that consists of an elementary, middle and high school. My childhood home didn’t have running water, pluming, or electric till I was 12 years old. I spent my high school years in a boarding school in New Mexico, after high school I moved to Phoenix to start a career in the medical field, I was a Nursing assistant for about 6 years working in long term care, rehabilitation, and med-surg floor in a hospital. Realizing that I had more fun in my robotics club than in my chosen field, decided to switch majors and I am a student at Gateway Community College earning credits in Computer Science, I will be a first-generation college graduate within my family.</p>
